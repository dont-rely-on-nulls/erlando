#+TITLE: Erlando 

* About

This is a fork of [[https://github.com/rabbitmq/erlando][erlando]]; a library that adds extra syntax expressions for Erlang, such as /cut/, and /do-notation/,
improving Erlang's usability.

* Roadmap

** TODOs
- Make it work with latest Erlang
- Add CI that runs tests
- Publish as a separate package

** Done

* Instructions

For now, because the goal is just updating it and making available as a package, the functionality is the same as the
original version. Thus, you can check how to use the library [[https://github.com/rabbitmq/erlando/blob/master/README.md][here]].

# Test commands that should be included in CI later
# test_do:test() test_cut:test() test_import_as:test()
